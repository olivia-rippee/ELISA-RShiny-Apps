# ELISA-RShiny-Apps
RShiny apps I created for Kemin to automate ELISA assay planning, data quality assurance, and data analysis.

- **ELISA Data Analysis Parallelism and Ruggedness**: Generate summary statistics on your ELISA data for parallelism and ruggedness assessment.

- **ELISA edata QA Scan**: Check your ELISA edata for consistent plate labeling and matching serials between files prior to submission to CVB.

- **Clinical edata QA Scan**: Check your clinical edata for consistent animal IDs between two files (CSV or Excel).

- **Create CVB ELISA Files**: Create blank dilution, layout, OD, plate info, and serial testing CSV files for ELISA data collection and submission to the CVB.

- **ELISA Timepoints Calculator**: Determine timepoints for ELISA assays based on input incubation time and transfer between steps.
